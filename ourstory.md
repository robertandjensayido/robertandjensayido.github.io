# How We Met
<small>(*her side*)</small>

February 9, 2011: *The night it all started.*
I showed up at the TESC Date Auction with my sorority sister, and a **game plan**: We buy each other for cheap and walk away with two extra tickets to Impulse, the UCSD Engineering Semi-Formal (Just as nerdy as it sounds). I successfully bid and "bought" my sorority sister. **Everything was going according to plan!** I stood up there, waiting for the bidding to end after my sister raised her hand, but then Robert had to go and ruin it by bidding higher and being the final bidder...**sucker**. As he handed me my ticket and promptly scurried out of the room, I thought *"Well, at least he's cute!"*

The night of the dance, I was a little nervous but excited. We met up and shared a few dances before parting ways...**wait**. *"That was it? No number?"* Sadly, yes that's where our story ended for the night. After the dance, I was the first to reach out, via social media of course, hoping something would come about.

Nothing happened, **oh well**. We didn't talk too much after that but we ran into each other sometimes on campus. He'd walk me to work after his class or we'd stop and chat at the bus stop. Poor guy didn't get the hint that I was interested. So a couple months later, I tried again to see if we could hang out by using my work's event as an excuse.

He showed up! *But brought friends with him...*

Before I knew it, 2011 was almost over. We could never seem to move past the casual passing conversations and I was tired of dropping hints every now and then. I was about to give up, when...

# How We Met
<small>(*his side*)</small>

So if you read *her side*, you'll see that she starts with the TESC Date Auction of 2011. Well, truth be told, it started even before that - a year, to be exact.

In February at UCSD, comes one of the best times of the year - E-Week, a celebration of all things engineering. This concludes at the end of the week with a date auction, leading up to Impulse, the engineers "formal". That year, the TESC leadership started a talent show to add to the fun.

As a freshly minted member of Tau Beta Pi, I was part of a group that represented TBP and we did an acapella version of "Don't Stop Believing" (this was while Glee was still very hip). After we finished, feeling like we nailed it, up go these two Phi Sigma Rho sisters, and blow everybody away with their rendition of "Bear Rock", a tribute to our very own UCSD Bear Rock.

And ever since then, I couldn't get her beautiful melodies out of my head.

[Especially when she's belting out Adele in the car at the top of her lungs, but that's different..]

So smitten was I by her, that I immediately..did nothing. For like, a year. I saw her again at the TESC talent show of 2011, and was quite giddy, but again, couldn't muster up the courage to say anything of substance. But then the TESC Date Auction arrived...now, if you read *her side*, you know how it ended up...

What she failed to tell you was how I got into that mess. So, my roommate/fellow TESCie/awesome friend, Justin, knew about how hard I fell for Jen after seeing her two years in a row at the talent show (and many of those late night chats where you just stare up at the ceiling pondering life together). After we had auctioned ourselves off, she was up next. Sitting next to Justin, he prodded me, "Dude, you should bid for her!"

And me, being a very logical fellow, had this thought process: "Well, the female TESCie before her went for like, $100, so I'll put in a bid for $25 just to up the ante so that maybe she'll notice me, without me winning so that I'm not _that guy_." [I only say it was $25 just to egg her on to say "it was $40!!"] It certainly helped that Justin egged me on (and for that I thank you Justin). So, I raised my card, and placed the bid.

The room went dead silent. And that's when I realized that nobody was gonna up my bid. I went into panic mode, looked around the room, imploring anyone, _anyone_, to up the bid so that I wouldn't be _that guy_.

I became _that guy_...the guy who bids (and successfully purchases) a "date" (aka for Impulse: meet up with them at the dance, say hi, do nothing) with someone she doesn't know. I sheepishly walked up to Jen and remember saying something to the effect of, "Hi, I guess I bought you, ha...here's your tickets..see you at the dance I guess!" And she just smiled at me, nodded, laughed a little, and I walked away pinching myself for having actually talked to her, and "bought" her, all in one go.

The next night came, and I saw her at the dance, took some photos with her, danced a little bit, had some good smiles and laughs, and then...per my M.O., did absolutely nothing for _almost_ another year. But thankfully, senioritis kicked in, and I said "screw it", and mustered up the courage to...send her a Facebook message about getting caffeinated beverages.

After many caffeinated beverages, road trips, flights, IKEA trips, puppy accidents, puppy baths, laughs, tears, hellos, goodbyes, and one bungled proposal later, here we are, ready to take the next step in our adventure through life together!

# In Summary
There you have it. *The start of us*.

**253 days** later, we went from *first meeting to first date*.  
**1,163 days** after our first date, we went from *newly dating to newly engaged*.

CT may not be CA, but we've grown to make this our own adventure. When we're not playing with our adorable American Eskimo/Pomeranians, Chester and Maddie, we spend our weekends exploring the east coast. The concept of "seasons" was tough to grasp at first (*"what do you mean it's not always 75 and sunny like in San Diego?*) but we've found new activities to enjoy all year round.

From skiing and snowboarding in the Berkshires to biking 10 miles to our local Lyman Orchards, the both of us have really embraced the east coast living. Of course, we also enjoy relaxing and spending time in the comfort of our own home.

At night, we put on the aprons and chefs hats and make some delicious and healthy meals together. We've really expanded our culinary skills and recipe book while living out here.

As we head closer to the big day, we're both getting very excited for this next big adventure. With the love and support from our friends and family, we can't wait to start the new chapter in our lives together!
