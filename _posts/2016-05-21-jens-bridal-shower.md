Back in May, I was blessed enough to have my Bridal Shower, where I was literally showered with love from friends and family. It was a beautiful day in San Diego (when is it not?) and I was surrounded by some amazing women. We all went to [Marlene's Tea and Cakes](http://marlenesteaandcakes.com/), where we were served some delicious teas and nibbled on yummy finger foods! **THOSE SCONES!** Seriously some of the best scones I've ever had! If you're looking for a great tea place in San Diego, I highly recommend Marlene's! The food and service were both excellent :)

We played some fun games, like "Guess the Bride's Age" and Bridal Bingo. Our area was beautifully decorated with flowers and these adorable place cards with quotes from Robert! Every little detail was spectacular :)

I can't express how thankful I am for this tea party fit for Blair Waldorf. 

Shout out to my **AWESOME** Maid of Honor, Siyi. This bridal shower was everything and more and you did a fantastic job planning, organizing, and executing the tea party!
A huge thanks to my mom for continuously keeping in contact with Marlene's to ensure everything went smoothly. You're always so supportive <3
Thank you to my Auntie Gloria for taking the gorgeous pictures (below) of the venue! You've perfectly captured the wide variety of my facial expressions and those delicious scones!
Thanks to those who traveled near and far to be with me and celebrate this momentous occasion! I am extremely grateful for your love and support.
