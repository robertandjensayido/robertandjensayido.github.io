<center><img src="/assets/page_images/bridesmaids/Siyi.jpg" /></center>

<p><strong>Siyi: Maid of Honor</strong>: Siyi and Jen met in college when UCSD decided that putting these two in the same room was a good idea. They instantly clicked over marching band (they both played clarinet) and High School Musical (and they both love Zac Efron). From that night on, the CPiCs, Crazy Partners in Crime, have been known for their outrageous “How-To” videos, weekend long foodventures, and celebrity filled activities. Siyi is from Fremont, CA and is currently a Research Associate for a stem cell lab at UCSF.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/page_images/bridesmaids/Karissa.jpg" /></center>

<p><strong>Karissa: Bridesmaid</strong>: Karissa and Jen have known each other since their bando days in the high school marching band. The two coolest clarinet players joined forces with Christina and have been BFFFs ever since. Even though Karissa and Jen haven’t lived in the same state since high school, they continue to stay close through their hilarious texts, occasional cruise vacations, and annual sushi date with “Sheila” aka Christina. Karissa lives in Omaha, Nebraska, where she provides counseling services as an Outpatient Therapist.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/page_images/bridesmaids/Christina.jpg" /></center>

<p><strong>Christina: Bridesmaid</strong>: Christina and Jen have known each other since they were 10, when they played on the same softball team. They remained friends throughout high school and together with Karissa, the three BFFFs have maintained a tight-knit friendship. In college, Christina and Jen were roomies at the famous “Cheddabush” house, where they continued playing softball together and laughing at all of the ridiculous things Christina says. Christina currently works as an Insurance Claims Assistant in San Diego, CA.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/page_images/bridesmaids/April.jpg" /></center>

<p><strong>April: Bridesmaid</strong>: April is Robert’s sister and Jen’s future sister-in-law. April and Jen may have only known each other for a short while, but it doesn’t stop them from sharing laughs over the Amezquita dogs and Robert’s weird antics. When the two of them are in town, they like to take a break from their pesky brothers and catch up over Mrs. Amezquita’s delicious food. April is a Storyboard Artist for Nickelodeon in Los Angeles, CA.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/page_images/bridesmaids/Jess.jpg" /></center>

<p><strong>Jess: Bridesmaid</strong>: Jess and Jen became friends at UCSD, when Jen picked up Jess as her Little Sis in Phi Sigma Rho. The “Princess and Precious” duo immediately became known for their #adorable pictures and their “obnoxious” poses. They bonded over food, fun, and photobombing as many pictures as possible. Jess resides in Orange County, CA, where she’s a Rehabilitation Aide, studying to become a Physical Therapist.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/page_images/bridesmaids/Grace.jpg" /></center>

<p><strong>Grace: Bridesmaid</strong>: Grace and Jen met in college when the both of them were pledging for Phi Sigma Rho. They’ve literally taken their friendship from coast to coast, as the both of them now live on the east where they’ve adopted the fashion-forward east coast style. From hanging out in NYC and Boston to keeping it low key in CT and NH, the distance has only helped these two CA girls become closer. Dr. Grace is currently an Optometrist in Nashua, New Hampshire.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/page_images/bridesmaids/Gab.jpg" /></center>

<p><strong>Gab: Bridesmaid</strong>: Gab is Jen’s oldest childhood friend. Growing up, these two were inseparable, constantly begging their parents to let them have ANOTHER sleepover so they could play Barbies and watch the Spice World movie. They continue to have one of the strongest friendships (20+ years!) and now beg their parents to let them lay in the middle of the cul-de-sac at night, so they can reminisce about the fun they had as kids. Gab is a recent Psychology graduate from UCSD and currently lives in San Diego, CA.</p>
