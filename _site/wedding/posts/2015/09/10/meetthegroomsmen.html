<center><img src="/assets/page_images/groomsmen/edo.jpg" height="300" alt="edo" /></center>
<p><strong>Edward: Best Man</strong>
“Edo” and “Robbo” have been friends since the fifth grade, when on the school field trip to Balboa Park, a younger version of Ed came up to a younger version of Rob and asked “Why the heck do you play violin?” Instead of taking offense to that question, Rob realized he had a lifelong, best friend in front of him. Through thick and thin, awkward and slightly less awkward phases of life, Rob and Ed form a fearsome duo in Cards Against Humanity. Ed hails from the land of maple leafs and moose, but you would be forgiven for thinking his motherland was Russia after a few drinks as he takes on his (in)famous Russian accent. Edo has taken his dedication to music to a new level, pursuing a PhD in composition at the University of California - Los Angeles.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/page_images/groomsmen/matt.jpg" height="300" alt="Matt" /></center>
<p><strong>Matt: Groomsman</strong>
Back when bleached tips were cool, and backpacks with wheels were slightly less cool, Matt and Robert rolled in the deep of middle school as resident orch-dorks (along with Edo of course). Their friendship was cemented when little Robert could not figure out Vivaldi’s triplet-like rhythm from “Spring”, when Matt took pity on him and decided to try and be nice to him. Thankfully, Robert ditched the rolly backpack after trying to make it totally hip, and ever since then, Rob and Matt have been steadfast friends, through distance and Chinchillas. Matt is a mercenary of music and code, throwing down tunes all across California with a variety of groups such as Bogg, putting together fantastic productions with his production company, and coding up company websites on a full stack of awesome, all from the beautiful city of Chico, CA.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/page_images/groomsmen/kdick.jpg" height="300" alt="Kevin D" /></center>
<p><strong>Kevin D: Groomsman</strong>
Kevin was one-third of the infamous trifecta of freshman English class, alongside Matt and the other Kevin on this list. But it wasn’t until an especially intense session of studying for AP Biology in the kids section of Barnes and Noble that acquaintance became friendship - it was all fun and games, until M&amp;M’s were involved. Many more adventures followed thereafter - a near cliffhanger at the Elven forest, epic puddle hunting, and Blackout Friday, leveled up Kevin and Rob’s friendship from FF, to BFFs. Though that almost came to an end after one particular session of Left 4 Dead involving a failed jump onto a helicopter. Kev is an IT professional focusing on security, so be careful to not get on his bad side, or else he might L33T HAXX0R your bluetooth connection. While he travels the world debugging other people’s mistakes, he calls the beautiful city of Irvine, CA home.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/page_images/groomsmen/kweng.jpg" height="300" alt="Kevin W" /></center>
<p><strong>Kevin W: Groomsman</strong>
Wengster, another third of the infamous trifecta, is a man you can rely on when all else fails. The one who you can talk to about anything at 3 AM for hours, despite having a pressing deadline in less than 6 hours - he’s the guy you make time for, because you just love him that much. His smile, his laugh, and his boyish, lack-of-facial hair good looks endear you, and me, to him. He’s the guy who, after bragging about that totally awesome party you’re gonna get into because he’s in a fraternity-don’t-call-it-a-frat, bro, you’re willing to wait up for 5 hours after he gets arrested for “assaulting” (aka patting on the back) a police officer at a college party (long story short: undercover cops who act like total bros are jerks). KWeng has since cleaned up his act, and after a career change from mechanical engineer to L33T hacker, is now a fellow at Code Reactor in San Francisco, CA, looking to get in on the startup world before the bubble bursts.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/page_images/groomsmen/akshay.png" height="300" alt="Akshay" /></center>
<p><strong>Akshay: Groomsman</strong>
Akshay is a true friend, one who speaks deeply from the heart with you one moment, and drinks deeply from that nasty bottle of whatever you brought over the next. Having met as fellow bioengineers at UC San Diego, Akshay and Rob and three other cool dudes shacked up together for the last two years of college, and along with a bunch of other cool people living practically next door, had some of the craziest nights together. Hitting up all the best electro concerts and beer SD had to offer, conquering Vegas craps tables (well, Akshay at least), and doing a whirlwind tour of Norcal and New England, Akshay is a man’s man, the guy who you would take a punch for - except he’s the one that took it instead, because you were a little distracted. Akshay is now pursing a PhD in Stanford’s Dept. of Bioengineering, working on solving medical imaging so that doctors don’t have to poke around inside you so much, in beautiful Palo Alto, CA.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/page_images/groomsmen/stefan.jpg" height="300" alt="Stefan" /></center>
<p><strong>Stefan: Groomsman</strong>
Stefanabanana is a fellow prisoner of PhD studies at Yale University, hailing from the beautiful coast of Florida. Stefan and Rob met after Rob came up to him and a group of other computational biologists commenting about how cool they were, and what classes they were taking. Little did they know that they would end up joining the Kleinstein lab together. After countless hours in a row at hackathons, teaching events, and other group projects, and weekends seeing more of each other than their significant others, somehow, Rob and Stefan are still the best of friends and partners - mostly thanks to Stefan’s immense amount of patience with Rob when he throws up crazy-stupid ideas. Partners in crime in solving everything from online learning, to predicting patient readmissions, and finding you a super sweet flight deal from JetBlue, Stefan is a member of the Kleinstein lab in the Computational Biology &amp; Bioinformatics program, and together with Rob they will persevere through to the bittersweet end of the PhD!</p>

<center><img src="/assets/page_images/groomsmen/mikey.jpg" height="300" alt="Mikey" /></center>
<p><strong>Mikey: Groomsman</strong>
Mikey has a heart of gold, a guy who values family, friends, and the happiness of others above all else. Well, unless you dig into his Kona Mud Pie, then all bets are off. Kidding aside, Mikey never has anything but a smile on his face, and wears his heart on his sleeve. However, that same heart doesn’t seem to know what sports team to root for because he switches teams like the clothes on his back - twice a day, and sometimes thrice. After many trips together to exotic locales such as Hawaii, Tahoe, and Disneyland, Mikey and Rob care for one another like brothers, and don’t need the workings of the law to call each other just that. Mikey works in the services industry all across America’s finest city - San Diego, CA.</p>
